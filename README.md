<h3><strong>📄 PROJECTS 📄</strong></h3>

<br><strong>Personal Portfolio 🌐<br></strong>
<br>My Personal Portfolio project serves as a showcase of my skills, experience, and work as a front-end developer.<br> Combining HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript, I designed a professional and visually appealing portfolio website. HTML structured the content, CSS styling was applied to achieve a consistent design, and JavaScript might be used for interactive elements. The portfolio demonstrates my ability to create a comprehensive online presence that reflects my abilities and achievements.<br>

<br><strong>To-Do List ✅<br></strong>
For the To-Do List project, I utilized a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive task management tool. HTML was employed to structure the elements of the list, CSS to style them in a visually appealing manner, and JavaScript to enable dynamic functionality. Users can add, edit, and remove tasks directly on the webpage, and the list updates in real time without requiring a page reload. This seamless interaction was achieved through the use of event listeners and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

<br><strong>Bootstrap Responsive Design and Hamburger Menu 📱<br></strong>
Incorporating Bootstrap, I designed a responsive and user-friendly webpage. Bootstrap's grid system allowed me to create a layout that adapts fluidly to different screen sizes. Additionally, I implemented a responsive navigation menu using Bootstrap's built-in components. To enhance mobile usability, I integrated a hamburger menu that reveals navigation options when clicked, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.<br>

<br><strong>Calculator 🧮<br></strong>
The Calculator project was developed using HTML for the structure, CSS for the visual design, and JavaScript for the functional logic. Users can perform basic arithmetic operations on a digital calculator interface. JavaScript handles the calculations based on user inputs, ensuring accurate results. CSS styling was applied to replicate the appearance of a physical calculator, making the user experience intuitive and familiar.<br>

<br><strong>Futuristic Particle Animation ✨<br></strong>
This project showcases my creativity in combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an eye-catching futuristic particle animation. HTML provided the canvas for the animation, while CSS was used to position and style the elements. The animation's movement and behavior were achieved through JavaScript, creating a dynamic and visually engaging effect that captures users' attention.<br>

<br><strong>Snow Man ☃️<br></strong>
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I designed an interactive Snow Man project. HTML structured the snowman's components, CSS was applied to style and position each element, and JavaScript was used to add interactivity. Users can interact with the snowman by toggling various elements, demonstrating my ability to blend design and functionality seamlessly.<br>

<br><strong>Typing Text Animation with JavaScript ⌨️<br></strong>
For the Typing Text Animation project, I employed JavaScript to create a dynamic typing effect. The HTML markup served as the foundation for the animation, CSS was used for styling, and JavaScript added the animation behavior. The text appears as if it's being typed out in real-time, adding a visually engaging touch to the content.<br>

<br><strong>Cosmic Nexus: Particle Odyssey 🌌<br></strong>
Cosmic Nexus is an ambitious project that combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a captivating particle animation experience. HTML structured the animation canvas, CSS styled the particles and background, and JavaScript orchestrated the intricate movement and interaction of particles. The result is an immersive cosmic journey that demonstrates my ability to push creative boundaries using web technologies.

<br><strong>Photo Figures Challenge 🖼️<br></strong>
The Photo Figures Challenge project demonstrated my ability to combine HTML and CSS to recreate and style various shapes using only HTML elements and CSS properties. By leveraging CSS's box model, positioning, and styling properties, I was able to replicate geometric figures and designs without relying on external graphics. This project showcased my proficiency in CSS and understanding of layout manipulation.

<br><strong>Ferris Wheel 🎡<br></strong>
The Ferris Wheel project involved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive simulation of a ferris wheel. HTML structured the elements of the ferris wheel, CSS was applied to style its appearance, and JavaScript powered the animation and user interaction. The ferris wheel spins and responds to user clicks, illustrating my ability to combine all three web technologies to create dynamic and interactive web experiences.

<br><strong>Nutrition Label 🍏<br></strong>
The Nutrition Label project demonstrated my skills in combining HTML and CSS to design a responsive and visually appealing nutrition label. HTML was used to structure the label's content, while CSS styling was applied to replicate the appearance of an actual nutrition label found on food products. The project emphasized attention to detail and responsive design principles to ensure the label's readability across different screen sizes.

<br><strong>Piano 🎹<br></strong>
Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed a virtual piano that users can play using their computer keyboard or mouse. HTML structured the piano keys, CSS styling was applied to create the visual layout, and JavaScript enabled the piano's sound generation and interactivity. The project highlighted my ability to create user-friendly interfaces that provide both visual and auditory experiences.

<br><strong>City Skyline 🏙️<br></strong>
For the City Skyline project, I used HTML and CSS to craft a stylized city skyline. <br>
HTML organized the components of the skyline, and CSS was used to create the skyline's aesthetic, <br>
including the arrangement of buildings and their appearances. The result was a visually engaging<br>
representation of a cityscape, showcasing my skills in design and layout composition.<br>

<br><strong>Tribute Page 📜<br></strong>
For the Tribute Page project, I employed HTML and CSS to create a webpage dedicated to honoring a <br>
particular individual or subject. HTML was used to structure the content, including headings, paragraphs, <br>
and images that provide information about the subject. CSS was applied to style the content, ensuring a 
visually appealing layout with appropriate fonts, colors, and spacing. Additionally, JavaScript could be 
utilized to add interactive elements such as image sliders or tooltips to enhance the user experience.<br>

The goal of the Tribute Page project was to effectively communicate the significance and achievements of the 
subject while demonstrating my proficiency in structuring content and styling webpages.

<br><strong>Survey Form 📝<br></strong>
The Survey Form project involved utilizing HTML and CSS to design a user-friendly and responsive survey or 
questionnaire. HTML was used to create form elements such as text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, and 
dropdown menus. CSS was applied to style the form elements, making them visually cohesive and easy to navigate. 
The form was designed to adapt to different screen sizes using responsive design principles.<br>

<br>Furthermore, JavaScript could be incorporated to validate user input, providing real-time feedback 
and ensuring that the submitted data meets the required criteria.<br>
<br>
<br>The Survey Form project showcased my ability to create functional and aesthetically pleasing forms, enhancing
the user experience while collecting valuable information.<br>
